"The OSIRIS-REx mission marks a bright spot in what will soon be a dark time for NASA’s solar system exploration program. By the time the spacecraft arrives at Bennu in 2018, there will be no spacecraft visiting or en route to any of the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—for the first time since 1979" - <a href = "http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/2016/20160809-osiris-rex-lifts-off.html">Jason Davis, <cite>The Planetary Society</cite>
